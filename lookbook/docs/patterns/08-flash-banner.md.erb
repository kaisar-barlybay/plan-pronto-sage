This component defines a specific use case of the Primer `Banner` component, consisting of an overlay around it to simplify its use as a flash in OpenProject.

## Overview

To use a Primerised flash, the `Meetings::UpdateFlashComponent` was introduced.

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::FlashPreview, :default, panels: %i[source] %>

## Usage

When a Primerised flash is required, this component can be used by calling `update_flash_message_via_turbo_stream()`. Under the hood, this prepends via turbo stream the `UpdateFlashComponent` in the `flash-container` div within the base layout.

The icon, message, dismiss scheme, and scheme are configurable identically to the Primer `Banner` component.

Two widths are supported, selectable via `full`. Depending on this value, the max width is capped or left unrestricted.

A `button` is optionally possible. When enabled, a link is included in the flash banner. `button_message` and `button_path_object` are used to configure the button text and linked path.

## Further Examples

### Danger:

As this is a common use case, the method `render_error_flash_message_via_turbo_stream()` is provided, generating a flash with `scheme: :danger` and `icon: :stop` by default.

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::FlashPreview, :danger, panels: %i[source] %>

<% if false %>
### With optional button:

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::FlashPreview, :button, panels: %i[source] %>
<% end %>
